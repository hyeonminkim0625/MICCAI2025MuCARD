## Introduction

Accurate classification of retinal diseases—such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy—is critical to prevent irreversible vision loss.  
Existing screening solutions often fail when encountering images from new fundus cameras.  
The MuCaRD challenge aims to drive development of AI models that are robust and adaptable across diverse camera types.

## Challenge Description

**Tasks:**
- **Task 1:** Zero-shot classification of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy on unseen fundus cameras.  
- **Task 2:** Few-shot test-time adaptation with 5–10 support images for new camera types.

**Datasets:**  
– NIH AIREADI (Optomed Aurora, Eidon)  
– Mediwhale (Optomed Aurora, Mediworks FC162, Topcon NW400, Optos Ultra Wide, Canon CR2)

**Metrics:** AUC, F1-score, inference time (composite score S = AUC + 0.5·F1 – 0.05·time).
